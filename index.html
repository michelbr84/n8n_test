    <article>
      <p>Google has announced the Pixel 10 family — the Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL — bringing expanded on-device AI, upgraded camera systems and improved battery life. The new lineup focuses on computational photography, tighter integration of AI features into everyday tasks, and refinements in design and display across the three models.</p>

      <div class="grid">
        <div>
          <h2>What’s new at a glance</h2>
          <p>The Pixel 10 series centers on three pillars: smarter on-device AI, markedly improved camera hardware and software, and longer runtime thanks to power optimizations and larger batteries. Google emphasizes real‑world photography upgrades and AI tools that simplify editing, assistive typing and voice tasks without always needing cloud connectivity.</p>

          <h2>Models and hardware</h2>
          <p>The lineup includes three sizes to cover a broad range of users: a standard Pixel 10, a Pixel 10 Pro, and a Pixel 10 Pro XL with a larger display and extended battery capacity. All models adopt refined industrial design cues — rounded edges, premium finishes (including indigo/teal hues shown in the hero image) and improved durability.</p>

          <h2>Cameras and imaging</h2>
          <p>Photography receives the most prominent upgrades. The Pixel 10 family uses a triple‑camera configuration on the back, with larger sensors and improved optics in the Pro variants. Computational photography advances include faster HDR, enhanced night and portrait modes, more capable telephoto zoom on Pro models, and AI‑assisted editing tools that intelligently remove objects, reconstruct details and produce refined composites.</p>

          <h2>On‑device AI features</h2>
          <p>Google is pushing AI deeper into the phone. Expect improved assistant interactions, smarter real‑time transcription and translation, and photo enhancements that run locally on the device for privacy and speed. New workflows let users make complex edits, summarize long messages, or handle reminders with contextual AI suggestions.</p>

          <h2>Battery life and performance</h2>
          <p>Battery life is improved across the range through a combination of larger cells and efficiency gains in the latest Tensor‑family silicon. Google highlights longer daily runtime for typical mixed use, adaptive charging profiles, and faster power management that favors prolonged battery health.</p>

          <h2>Software and updates</h2>
          <p>The Pixel 10 series ships with the latest Android version and continues Google’s multi‑year update promise. Expect exclusive Pixel features at launch, with additional AI enhancements arriving via software updates over the coming months.</p>

          <h2>Design and displays</h2>
          <p>The devices offer bright, color‑accurate OLED displays with high refresh rates on the Pro models. The aesthetic is minimalist and modern, with premium glass and aluminum construction and new colorways focused on muted indigo and teal tones.</p>

          <h2>Pricing & availability</h2>
          <p>Google announced tiered pricing for the Pixel 10 family, with the base Pixel aimed at mainstream buyers and the Pro / Pro XL positioned above it. Exact regional prices and pre‑order dates vary by market — check Google’s regional store or the linked source below for the official pricing and availability details in your country.</p>

          <h2>Verdict</h2>
          <p>The Pixel 10 series refines Google’s approach: smarter, more private AI on device, stronger camera hardware and software, and better battery life. For photography enthusiasts and users who value on‑device AI features, the Pro models are the obvious pick; the standard Pixel 10 remains a compelling choice for most buyers.</p>
